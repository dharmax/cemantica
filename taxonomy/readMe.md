**Taxonomy Rules**

Taxonomy files are to end with _.tax.txt_

The **first line** in a file is the *topic* name.
 
The **rest of the lines are definitions**: one definition per line. 
 
Empty lines are ignored (except the first, which must be the topic). Strings are trimmed.

A simple definition is simply a word (a string - could be more than a single word). Meta-data can be added a JSON after a comma, after the basic string.
